<h1>Client server Concept</h1>
<img src="/home/exam1/Desktop/sreyas_s1_mca/clientServerArc.jpeg" width=250px height=250px>
In client server computing, the clients requests a resource and the server provides that resource. A server may serve multiple clients at the same time while a client is in contact with only one server. Both the client and server usually communicate via a computer network but sometimes they may reside in the same system.

An illustration of the client server system is given as follows −

<h1>Characteristics of Client Server Computing</h1>
The salient points for client server computing are as follows:

The client server computing works with a system of request and response. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the desired information.
The client and server should follow a common communication protocol so they can easily interact with each other. All the communication protocols are available at the application layer.
A server can only accommodate a limited number of client requests at a time. So it uses a system based to priority to respond to the requests.
Denial of Service attacks hindera servers ability to respond to authentic client requests by inundating it with false requests.
An example of a client server computing system is a web server. It returns the web pages to the clients that requested them.

<h1>Difference between Client Server Computing and Peer to Peer Computing</h1>
<pre>
The major differences between client server computing and peer to peer computing are as follows:

In client server computing, a server is a central node that services many client nodes. On the other hand, in a peer to peer system, the nodes collectively use their resources and communicate with each other.
In client server computing the server is the one that communicates with the other nodes. In peer to peer to computing, all the nodes are equal and share data with each other directly.
Client Server computing is believed to be a subcategory of the peer to peer computing.
</pre>
<h5>Advantages of Client Server Computing</h5>
<h6>The different advantages of client server computing are −</h6>
<pre>
All the required data is concentrated in a single place i.e. the server. So it is easy to protect the data and provide authorisation and authentication.
The server need not be located physically close to the clients. Yet the data can be accessed efficiently.
It is easy to replace, upgrade or relocate the nodes in the client server model because all the nodes are independent and request data only from the server.
All the nodes i.e clients and server may not be build on similar platforms yet they can easily facilitate the transfer of data.
</pre>
<h1>Disadvantages of Client Server Computing<h1>
<h2>The different disadvantages of client server computing are −<h2>
<pre>
If all the clients simultaneously request data from the server, it may get overloaded. This may lead to congestion in the network.
If the server fails for any reason, then none of the requests of the clients can be fulfilled. This leads of failure of the client server network.
The cost of setting and maintaining a client server model are quite high.

Components, links, and policies are defined by plug-ins. When you create a virtual application pattern, 
the available components, links, policies, and configuration options are determined by the plug-ins that
are included with the selected pattern type.

<h1>Types of Content</h1>

There are different types of content on the web that you can use to cater to your audience’s needs. You will have to adjust your strategy depending on what type of content you use, as it directly impacts your site’s performance based on its quality and amount. Below are the some of most common types of web content:

<h2>Text Content</h2>
The first and most common type of content found online is text. Unlike other forms of media, the text is easily adaptable, and it can be written in many different styles. It can be formal and professional or casual and personal. This feature of the text is easily adaptable to different audiences and uses.
Text is a continuous series of characters, often without spaces or punctuation, which is represented visually as text in the form of writing, usually in the creator’s language. The text is easily adaptable to different audiences and is used through this feature.

<h2>Image-Based Content</h2>
Images are becoming more and more popular on the internet, where the following type of content comes in. Images accompany the text and provide visual context for readers when reading text that doesn’t include images. One can also upload images in their own right instead of being added through a short text post. Images are a prominent feature on the web and are created through photographs, graphics, vector art, or video. Images are widely used for branding.

<h2>Video Content</h2>
Video is another type of content that makes it onto sites’ homepage pages because it’s an effective way to attract attention. Videos can make your site more appealing through emotional appeal and visual appeal. It can be both fun and informative, or severe and educational.

Video is an effective way to attract attention because it’s a continuous series of images, sounds, or video clips represented visually as moving images in the form of communication. Using video on your site will make your site more appealing because it represents information clearly through a visual medium.

<h2>Multimedia Content</h2>
Multimedia content is considered any online media that includes more than one type of media. The most common forms of multimedia content include audio and video. Audio is music or sound used to show emotion or give spatial depth in a piece of writing. Sounds and music can accompany the images to create a practical effect when delivering a message in the video.

<h2>Interactive Content</h2>
Interactive content works precisely like a traditional website, except that it includes elements that use computer-based input devices such as computers, game boards, buttons, keyboards, and start-up firms. The user can interact with the content through these devices. Interactive content allows users to experience and play with the content more entertainingly. This type of content appeals to people with an analytical mind and those interested in finding solutions to problems.

<h2>Embedded Content</h2>
Embedded content is often found on video and audio players on websites, blogs, and social networking sites. This type of media is embedded into other pages and can be called up by clicking a link or button. This type of content allows you to reach a wider audience and deliver your message more appealingly, as it allows you to tailor your message according to the needs of your audience.

<h2>E-books</h2>
An e-book is a text-only book downloaded onto computers or other electronic devices, such as phones, where it can be displayed on a screen. It means that the user can read the book without using paper. E-books are also known as eBooks E-book is an acronym for electronic book, a term coined by Sony. E-books are available in a wide range of formats and have varying levels of interactivity.

<h2>Audio-Visual Content</h2>
An Audio-Visual A/V is any media that includes audio and visual material such as television, film, slideshows, and computer-generated images. It means they are also known as Spoken Word – Visual Content. They are mainly used for entertainment, education, and information purposes. This type of content is becoming more popular because it creates an effective way to deliver messages and ideas. A/V content is also a popular feature of websites because it helps with users’ user engagement.

<h1> Overview of http</h1>

HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.

Basic Features
There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:

HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.

HTTP is media independent: It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.

HTTP is stateless: As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.

<h1>Generation of dynamic web page</h1>

In comparison to unnecessary page generation of the prior art, the page generation time according to the current invention is substantially reduced, and the generated page is efficiently accessed. 
Since in response to at least one of a predetermined set of update events, a page is dynamically generated in advance  of a user page request and the dynamically generated page is stored, the current invention allows the efficient page access. 
The efficient page access is accomplished by storing the dynamically generated page as a static page at a URL identified by a page access call with an argument. Thus, the user accesses the previously generated dynamic page at a high-speed. 
The use of the prior art technologies such as proxy servers in combination further improves the cost of transmission of the page to the user according to the current invention.

<h1>Application Sever</h1>
<img src="file:///home/exam1/Desktop/sreyas_s1_mca/applicationserver.webp" width=250px height=250px>

An application server is a server that hosts applications[1] or software that delivers a business application through a communication protocol.[2]

An application server framework is a service layer model. It includes software components available to a software developer through an application programming interface. An application server may have features such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing. The goal is for developers to focus on the business logic.

<h1> Web Security</h1>

Web security is also known as cybersecurity (cyber security), or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of, or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

The field has become of significance due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet,[3] and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things (IoT). Cybersecurity is also one of the significant challenges in the contemporary world, due to the complexity of information systems, both in terms of political usage and technology. Its primary goal is to ensure the system's dependability, integrity, and data privacy.
